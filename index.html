		Hi,
		I am Muhammed Shameem. I am a Computer Science student currently pursuing Post Graduation at National Institute of Technology, Surathkal under Information Technology department. This page showcases my project works and little bit about myself. Currently this page is under heavy construction.

	<h2>Works</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Interactive Device Prototype<br/>
			<img src="images/content/kobo1.jpg"><p>
			Designed and developed an Interactive Device using ATmega328 microcontroller with help of open-source hardware project Arduino. Different sensors were used to collect the environmental awareness. Collected data using sensor-fusion were used to take decisions. Different locomotive and signalling actuators were helping the device to interact with ourtside world. This work was Inspired by a <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/massimo_banzi_how_arduino_is_open_sourcing_imagination">TedEx Talk</a> by <b>Massimo Banzi</b><i> (founder of Arduino Project)</i>.
			<br>
			This talk itrigued us to think about the possibilities of Interactive Devices. The things around us, sharing common world amoung us, what if they could talk about the things they feel about their sorroundings. It's cool when a plant is intelligent enough to tweet about its well being (consider: I'm groot !).

			DualIso: An Algorithm for Subgraph Pattern Matching on Very Large Labeled Graphs<br/>
			Base paper: <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6906821">link</a><br>
			Graph pattern matching is having great significance in this epoc of graph databases. Pattern matching in graph structures can be done using the property of graph isomorphism. This equally challenging and practically imaportant task is hindered by the NP-Completeness of sub-graph isomorphism. The above mentioned paper gave a simple elegent idea to reduce the space complexity and thus increasing the performance. This method uses fine pruning techniques to make this possible. Implementation of this paper was done as part of course work in NITK.<br>
